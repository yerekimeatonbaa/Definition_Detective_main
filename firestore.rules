 * @dataStructure
 *  - /userProfiles/{userId}: Stores user profile data, owned by the user.
 *  - /userProfiles/{userId}/gameSessions/{gameSessionId}: Stores game session data, owned by the user.
 *  - /leaderboardEntries/{leaderboardEntryId}: Stores leaderboard entries, publicly readable.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - Users can only access their own profiles and game sessions.
 *  - Leaderboard entries are publicly readable to facilitate competition and visibility.
 *  - Listing of user profiles is disallowed.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Not applicable, the design uses path-based ownership.
 * @structuralSegregation User data and public leaderboard data are stored in separate collections.
